# WireShrek
Small tool/Sublime plugin that should help to go though the Veeam log easier
Firstly, no warranty, just a free useful tool.
Second, usage and feeback appreciated
Thirdly, any issues are reviewed only here in the Issues section, no other way for communication in regards to features or bugs
(Sorry, may be different in future)

Enjoy! :)

The project will have a package section or the installer-like feature but not now.
This baby should be carried manually to your machine and installed. Later I will add more ellegant method.
Thanks for understanding!

Installation:
1. Download the Project as Zip file to your system
2. Open Sublime and if you did not install any plugin before then go to Tools -> Install package control
3. In the Sublime window, when the other desirable packages are installed, pls go to the:
Preference -> Package control -> Browse Packages
4. Unzip the WireShrek folder and put the folder as is in the Packages folder you opened on the previous step.
The folder name should remain WireShrek

Restart the Sublime may be necessary.

You can simply check if it went fine by right-clicking on the log - there should be one more point in the context menu - WireShrek

Released:
#Find to tab
The feature finds al the selected (even multiple) parts in the file and places all identical entried into a new tab. (Find all analog but economizes time)
